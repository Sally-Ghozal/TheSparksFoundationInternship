Task1: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 
Create the Decision Tree classifier for the iris dataset and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Our dataset is iris dataset which has 150 rows with 5 columns (4 features + class) where the class is the label of each flower whether it's setosa, virginica or versicolor.
